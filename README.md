# 🧠 Alzheimer's Detection

This repository provides a machine learning-based approach for the detection of Alzheimer's Disease using neuroimaging data. The goal is to assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's through deep learning techniques.

## 📝 Project Overview

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to die. Early detection can help in managing and potentially slowing down the disease. In this project, we utilize deep learning models trained on brain scan data to classify the stages of Alzheimer's.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the [Alzheimer's Dataset (4 Classes of Images)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset) which includes MRI images categorized into four classes:
- **Mild Demented**
- **Moderate Demented**
- **Non Demented**
- **Very Mild Demented**
